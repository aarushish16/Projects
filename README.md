# Projects
Welcome to my repository of experimental and research projects! This space is dedicated to sharing various coding experiments and research endeavors that Iâ€™m working on. Each project here represents a different facet of my exploration and investigation into data science, image classification, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks.
